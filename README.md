# Discord Music Bot

_I had a lot of fun with this project! I wanted to learn a new language to use, since I'm a first year CS major and have mainly coded in C++, so I chose to create a discord bot with discord.js. I spent most of the month reading up on Javascript, node.js, and discord.js and started the project very recently, but I'm excited to see where it goes! At the moment, the bot only plays music from attachments, but it will already help my friends and I a lot._

_Thank you so much for this!_
